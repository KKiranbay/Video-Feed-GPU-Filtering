# Video Feed GPU Filtering

## Description

This solution utilizes GPU acceleration for real-time video feed filtering. By harnessing the parallel processing power of modern GPUs, it achieves high-performance video processing, allowing for the smooth and efficient application of complex filters.

## Dependencies

To build and run this project, you'll need the following:

* **Visual Studio 2022**
* **vcpkg** with the following libraries installed:
    * OpenCV
    * dear imgui
    * SDL2
    * GL3W
* **CUDA Toolkit** (including NPP - NVIDIA Performance Primitives)

## Build Instructions

Follow these steps to build the project:

1.  **Install CMake:**
    * Ensure CMake is installed and accessible from your command line.

2.  **Set up vcpkg:**
    * Download and install vcpkg.
    * Set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to your vcpkg installation directory.
        * Example: `set VCPKG_ROOT=C:\src\vcpkg`
    * Add the vcpkg directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
        * Example: `set PATH=%PATH%;%VCPKG_ROOT%`

3.  **Generate Build Files:**
    * Create a new directory named `build` (or your preferred build folder name) inside the project's root directory.
    * Navigate into the `build` directory using your terminal.
    * Run the following CMake command to generate the Visual Studio solution:

        ```cmake
        cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
        ```
